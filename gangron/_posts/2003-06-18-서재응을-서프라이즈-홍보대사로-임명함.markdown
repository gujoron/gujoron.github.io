2.66 ERA for our ACE Jae Seo. That's gotta be top 10 material...or at least....top 11 :)
  
우리의 에이스(에이스라는 말 기분좋다.)서재응 2.66...아마 10위거나 11위일꺼야..메이즈리그중에서.

He was ninth in the majors in ERA when he was 2.88. He IS the ace. Thank God he wasn't hurt bad tonight.

if we lost him, it would be very hurtful and a major drop to the mets. but, he is ok and should make his next start against the yanks. he has been fantastic and against a team like the yankees who hit a lot of homers, shea is the place to be. especially since seo is a flyball pitcher. but, if he can go out and pitch like he did tonight, i don't see why he could not make the all star team, or at least have a chance in the R.O.Y award.
  
만약.......우리가 그를 잃게 된다면,,,,그것은 아주큰 슬픔이요.메츠의슬픔이다. 그러나 그는 괜찮을꺼야. 그는 양키스때 반드시 나올꺼야.(다음경기 양키스........기다려라.!..이치로도 기다려라..) 그는 많은 강타자가 있는 양키스에 대해 잘해낼꺼야. 서재응은 그곳에 있을꺼야.(강한 신념과 걱정) 왜냐면 특별히 플라이볼투수니까..(뜬공으로 마무리) 그러나 그는 거기서오늘처럼 잘할꺼야....(여기부터 중요) 나는 그가 왜 올스타가 될수 없는지 모르겠어(서재응이 투표에 없으니까) 그렇지만 적어도 그는 사이영상의 기회를 가질꺼야....ㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ컥.(놀랍다..사이영상까지...장난아니다.)

Honestly I dont think they Mets are even thinking playoffs at this point. I think they're probaly thinking lets just get some wins and to .500 first.
  
솔직히 난 매츠가 이번에 플레이오프못나갈꺼라 생각해. 나는 아마 5할대 승률을 매츠가 가져야 겨우 가능할꺼라 봐.

Wilson, Reyes, Phillips, Floyd, Seo, the building block are there. Maybe just a little more time. Just a little. With a few more acqusitions next season, WildCard is not out of the question. This team has a bright future.
  
윌슨, 래이어, 필립스, 서재응(ㅋㅋ) 이 블럭이 있어.(믿는다.) 아마 시간이 걸리겠지만 아주조금,,,다음시즌쯤,,,,(와일드카드는 제외하고.플레이오프나가는거).....그렇지만....이팀은 밝은 미래가 있따.( 서재응 다음시즌에는 완전에이스야.)

Thank God...he isn't expected to miss his next start. he just split a fingernail that has bothered him over the course of his career.
  
고맙습니다. 그는 다음 등판에 빠지기를 기대하지 않아요. 그는 단지 그의 재구를 괴롭히던 손톱만 빠졌다.

That's very good news, since he's been our best pitcher this year, and would be one of the best pitchers this season in baseball IF he got more run support.
  

  
정말 좋은 뉴스다. 왜냐면 그는 우리 최고의 투수다 그리고 만약 그가 더 뛸수있다면 올해 최고의 투수가 될거야.

Wait, how can he NOT miss the next start if he broke his fingernail? It takes a while for the fingernail to grow you know...
  

  
잠깐만 ,,,만약 그가 그의 손톱이 빠졌는데 어케 다음 겜 안뛸수있지?(걱정) 아마 손톱자랄려면 많이 걸릴텐데...흑흑

Did you notice that he kept looking at that nail all night. It was bothering him earlier in the game too.
  
위에 분 보고 하는 말) 너 아냐, 서재응은 오늘밤에도 손톱을 보고 있었어.손톱은 늘 그를 괴롭혔엇따.(걱정없다는 말)

i think it's a split nail, so it's still there. i would guess it split lengthwise, so maybe a little crazy glue? :)
  
나는 단지 손톱이 약간 부러졌다고만 생각해...세로로 말이야..붙이면 될꺼야..하하..

Living in Seattle (and a Mariners fan) I don't get to see many Mets games. But I'm Korean and it looks like Seo is doing a great job so far.
  
A question for you Mets fans: what kind of pitcher is Seo? What is his stuff?
  

  
Thank you.
  

  
마리너 팬인모양이네요.) 시에틀에 살면서 나는 매츠게임을 많이 못&#48419;어요.그러나 나는 한국인입니다. 서재응씨가 잘하고 있는것같아요.(교포인가보네요.)
  
질문하나 할께요 메츠팬이게...서재응은 어떤 종류의 투수인가요? 그의 무기는 뭔가요?

He's a control pitcher who consistently throws strikes and challenges batters. A tough pitcher for the batters to face indeed.
  
그는 컨터럴 투수에요. 스트라이크랑 체인져업을 던지는...실로 엄청난 투수죠

There's a good article on Seo from Tuesday's Newsday. It should answer some questions you may have about him.
